# myansible
This is my personal ansible situation to configure new workstations, laptops, and vms.

## installation
Run the following to set up your environment (install ansible, git, etc... and clone the repo).

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reppocs/myansible/main/init.sh
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```
